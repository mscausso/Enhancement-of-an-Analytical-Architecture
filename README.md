# Enhancement of an Analytical Architecture

A proposed data architecture for a company that wanted to solve the data transition issue, as there was no real-time data available to support decision-making by users. The standardization of analytical tools across the company will help ensure that all information technology users use the same tools, creating compatibility between solutions. The differentiation of databases for reporting and predictability helps distribute software resources for better performance across all services.
